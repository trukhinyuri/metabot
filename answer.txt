## Implementation
### Step 1: Implement Secure Configuration Loading

Let's implement the `load_secure_config()` function in `utils.py` to securely load and decrypt API keys using AES-256 encryption with the `cryptography` library.

```python
import json
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

# Generate a key for encryption/decryption
# This should be done once and stored securely
# key = Fernet.generate_key()
# Save the key in an environment variable or a secure location
# print(key)

def load_secure_config():
    """
    Loads and decrypts the configuration settings using AES-256 encryption.
    The encryption key should be securely stored in an environment variable.
    """
    key = os.environ['CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY']
    cipher = Fernet(key)
    
    with open('config.json.enc', 'rb') as encrypted_file:
        encrypted_data = encrypted_file.read()
        
    decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)
    config = json.loads(decrypted_data)
    
    return config

# Example usage
# Ensure CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY is set in the environment before calling this function
# config = load_secure_config()
# print(config)
```

### Instructions for Secure Key Management

1. **Key Generation**:
   - You should generate the encryption key once and store it securely.
   - Use: `Fernet.generate_key()`

2. **Storage**:
   - Store the generated key in a secure location, such as an environment variable.
   - Example: `export CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY='your_generated_key_here'`

3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt your initial configuration (`config.json`) and save it as `config.json.enc`.

### Next Steps

1. **Encrypt and Prepare Configuration**:
   - Encrypt your existing `config.json` file with the generated key.
   - Store this file as `config.json.enc`.

2. **Test Secure Configuration Loading**:
   - Test the `load_secure_config()` function to ensure it retrieves and decrypts configuration correctly.

3. **WebSocket and Logging Enhancements**:
   - Proceed with enhancing WebSocket handling.
   - Ensure logging improvements capture detailed operations.

You can now proceed to encrypt your configuration and test the setup. If you need any further actions or enhancements, let me know!

## Testing
The secure configuration loading function `load_secure_config()` appears to be working correctly, as it successfully decrypted and loaded the configuration data.

### Next Steps

1. **Proceed with WebSocket and Logging Enhancements**: Implement the logic for WebSocket handling and add detailed logging to capture operations.

2. **Re-Test in Full Environment**: After these enhancements, perform another round of testing for the entire system.

If you need further assistance or specific enhancements, feel free to ask!

## Optimization
The code has been optimized with a focus on performance, error handling, and code quality. Hereâ€™s a summary of actions taken:

1. **`utils.py`**: Enhanced error handling and improved performance.
2. **`main.py`**: Improved code quality and added documentation.
3. **`metabot.py`**: Added robust error handling and optimized performance.

Backups for these files were created to ensure previous versions are retained.

### Next Steps
